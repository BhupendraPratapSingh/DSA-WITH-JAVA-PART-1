/*
Original Array = 5 4 3 2 3*
Stable sort : 2 3 3* 4 5
It means in  a stable Sort Duplicate Numbers ka bhi order same
hi rhega jo ki original Array mein hai.

Defination -> Stable Sort is sorting in  which order of appearences
of Duplicate Element is Same in the sorted array as given in
the original array.

Unstable Sort: 2 3* 3 4 5
Now Unstable Numbers mein iski koi guarantee nhi hai duplicate
wala number pehle bhi aa skta hai.

-> Unstable Sorting = Unstable Sort is sorting in  which order of appearences
of Duplicate Element may or may not be same. 


Q -> Is Bubble Sort is a Stable Algorithm.

Answere -> Yes , as we do not compare equal elements so we dont swap
them , therfore they are in their original order.

Q-> Is Bubble Sort is an in-place algorithm?

 Yes , as we did'nt create a new array.
