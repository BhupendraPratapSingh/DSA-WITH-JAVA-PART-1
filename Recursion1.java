/*Introduction to  a recusrive funtions
 * Recursion = A function/method calling itself
 example = ek method ke andar method ko hi call kr diya jai
 ex - void print()
 {
    print();
 }
 *  PMI = principal of mathmatical induction
 * Q = To prove that  Sum of first natural number is f(n) = n(n+1)/2.
 * Assumption = This formula is true for some no. f(K) = k(k+1)/2.(Faith).
 * proof 1 : Sum of first k natural number sum is (k+1)(k+2)/2.(self work).
 * proof 2 : Sum of first  1 natural numbers is 1  f(n) = 1.(Base Case).
 * for 1  , LHS = RHS.
 * Now do it (revise)
 * so PMI ke andar humne 4 cheeze dekhi
 * Faith/Assumption.
 * Self Work.
 * Base Case. 
 * Aur yahi points hum recursion mein bhi dekhege.
