/*A function calling itself with different parameters and 
 a base case to terminate the infinite loop
 * In recursion, we solve a bigger problem by solving smaller
 subproblems.
 * Thus in a recursion a function calls itself to solve its subproblem.
 * hum apni problems ko functions ke terms mein represent kr rhe hai
 * Functions -> Problem -> pi(n)
 * subproblem-> pi(n-1)
 */
/* The Recursion Spell
 * 1) Identifying the smaller problem -> let recursion solve it (with full faith)
 * aur subproblem ko identify krne ke baad us problem ko recursion se solve krne
 ka try kriye essentialy same method ko call kriye subproblem wale parameters deke.

 2)Self Work -> Do your work.

 3)  Identify the Base Case -> Smallest problem for which the answere is obvious.

 * Note -> Identify that ki recursive work pehle hona hai ya self work pehle
 hona hai.
